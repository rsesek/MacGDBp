// BSProtocolThreadInvoker will forward all messages that are part of |protocol|
// to its target |object| on the specified |thread| in the optional modes. This
// allows a client to hold this as a delegate and write thread-safe code with
// minimal work. The class also protects against the target |object| reentering
// itself; if it or something it calls runs a nested run loop, the messages
// will be queued until it would no longer reenter the object.
